#  This is the default configuration file shipped with fvwm.

#  This config file is organized as follows:
#
#    1: Functions
#    2: Styles
#    3: Colorsets
#    4: Menus
#    5: Bindings
#    6: Decor

# InfoStoreAdd can be used to store variable data internal to fvwm.
# The variable can then be used in the configuration as $[infostore.name].
#
# You can also use environment variables but for data internal to fvwm
# use InfoStore variables instead.
#
# The following is used in various menus and also sets the terminal
# that FvwmConsole uses. Change this to your terminal of choice
InfoStoreAdd terminal x-terminal-emulator

# This is used for "Run Command" and the Meta+Space key-binding.
# runcmd is the binary name and runcmdopt contains additional
# command line options.
InfoStoreAdd runcmd "rofi"
InfoStoreAdd runcmdopt "-show drun"

# DesktopConfiguration sets how fvwm handles desktops:
#
# * global -- the default. This means all screens show the same desktops/pages.
# * per-monitor -- every monitor has its own virtual desktop/pages.
#     For this mode it's recommended that FvwmPager is configured to
#     use the monitor configuration option, so that only windows on that
#     specific monitor are shown.
# * shared -- the virtual desktops are shared across all monitors and each
#     monitor shows a single desktop at a time. If one monitor switches to a
#     desktop currently being viewed by another, the two monitors swap which
#     desktop they are viewing.  This is similar to how Xmonad or Herbsflutwm
#     handle desks.  This mode only works with two or more monitors.

# Local configuration file. For use with the default-config.
#
# If $FVWMUSER_DIR/local.config ($HOME/.fvwm/local.config by default)
# exists, then read it. This allows changes to default-config settings
# without needing a full copy of the default-config. This will also allow
# default-config changes to get used after upgrades (if applicable).
